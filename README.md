# AI-Augmented Flow Methodology (AAFM)

**A Daily Iteration Framework for AI-Native Teams**

> Ship daily, learn continuously, augment infinitely

## Overview

The AI-Augmented Flow Methodology (AAFM) fundamentally reimagines agile software development for the AI era. Instead of sprint-based, 2-week cycles with human-limited throughput, AAFM introduces flow-based, 24-hour cycles with AI-amplified delivery velocity.

## Core Paradigm Shift

| Traditional Agile | AAFM |
|-------------------|------|
| Sprint-based, 2-week cycles | Flow-based, 24-hour cycles |
| Human-limited throughput | AI-amplified delivery velocity |
| Sequential validation | Parallel validation |
| Tools augment humans | AI as first-class team members |
| Bi-weekly feedback | Continuous daily feedback |

## Foundational Principles

1. **Daily Value Delivery** - Ship production-ready increments every 24 hours
2. **AI as First-Class Team Members** - Agents are peers, not tools
3. **Continuous Validation** - Testing and validation happen in parallel, not sequentially
4. **Micro-Batch Architecture** - Small, independently deployable work units
5. **Fast Feedback Loops** - Learn and adjust every 24 hours, not every 2 weeks

## Quick Start

1. **Read the Core Documentation**: Start with [Core Methodology](./docs/01-core-methodology.md)
2. **Understand the 24-Hour Cycle**: Review [The Daily Cycle Framework](./docs/02-daily-cycle.md)
3. **Set Up AI Agents**: Configure [AI Agent Roles](./docs/03-ai-agents.md)
4. **Use Templates**: Implement using [Meeting Templates](./templates/)
5. **Measure Progress**: Track with [Metrics Framework](./metrics/)
6. **Transition from SAFe**: Follow the [Transition Guide](./guides/safe-to-aafm-transition.md)

## Documentation Structure

### Core Documentation (`/docs`)

- [Daily Demo Template](./templates/daily-demo.md)
- [Daily Retrospective Template](./templates/daily-retrospective.md)
- [Portfolio Sync Template](./templates/portfolio-sync.md)
- [Work Item Template](./templates/work-item.md)

### Metrics & Measurement (`/metrics`)
- [Metrics Framework](./metrics/framework.md)
- [Velocity Metrics](./metrics/velocity.md)
- [AI Effectiveness Metrics](./metrics/ai-effectiveness.md)
- [Business Outcome Metrics](./metrics/business-outcomes.md)

### Tools (`/tools`)
- Scripts and utilities for implementing AAFM
- Automation helpers
- Monitoring dashboards

## Key Features

### The 24-Hour Cycle
- **Morning Sync** (30 min): Plan the day's outcomes
- **Parallel Execution** (6.5 hours): Human-AI pairing, continuous validation, automated pipelines
- **Daily Demo** (30 min): Stakeholder review and acceptance
- **Next Morning Retrospective** (30 min): Data-driven learning

### Micro-Epic Structure
Replace traditional epics with 24-hour deliverables:
```
Macro-Feature (Business Capability)
  ├── Micro-Epic 1 (Day 1 deliverable)
  ├── Micro-Epic 2 (Day 2 deliverable)
  └── Micro-Epic 3 (Day 3 deliverable)
```

### AI Agent Team
- **Requirement Analyst Agent**: Requirements analysis and acceptance criteria
- **Code Generation Agent**: Implementation and refactoring
- **Test Engineer Agent**: Comprehensive test generation
- **DevOps Agent**: CI/CD and infrastructure management
- **QA Validation Agent**: Quality and security scanning
- **Scribe Agent**: Documentation and knowledge management

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Backlog Engineering**: Pre-validated, properly sized, dependency-free items
2. **Technical Prerequisites**: Microservices, automated CI/CD, feature flags, observability
3. **Team Composition**: Include AI Orchestrator role and enhance existing roles
4. **Cultural Readiness**: Embrace daily delivery and AI collaboration

## Metrics That Matter

### Traditional Velocity (Enhanced)
- Production deployments per day
- Lead time (idea → production)
- Cycle time (start → done)

### AI Effectiveness (New)
- AI contribution percentage
- Human intervention rate
- AI suggestion acceptance rate
- Time saved through automation

### Business Outcomes
- Daily value delivered
- Customer feedback turnaround
- Defect escape rate
- Time-to-market improvement

## Philosophy

AAFM recognizes that AI has fundamentally changed the economics of software development. The limiting factor is no longer human typing speed or working hours—it's our ability to:

1. **Define value clearly** (what to build)
2. **Validate quality rapidly** (that it works)
3. **Orchestrate AI effectively** (leverage augmentation)
4. **Learn continuously** (adapt based on data)
