## Example: Complete Retrospective

```
Daily Retrospective - November 6, 2025

Part 1: AI Analytics (5 min)
AI Scribe: "Yesterday we delivered profile picture upload.
Lead time: 8.5 hours (vs. 8h target, +6%).
AI code contribution: 72%, tests: 89%.
Main bottleneck: CI pipeline (45 min due to flaky test).
Quality: 94% coverage, 0 vulnerabilities."

Part 2: 4Ls Discussion (20 min)

LIKED:
✅ Sarah: AI Test Engineer generated comprehensive suite, saved 2h
✅ Marcus: Pairing session with Code Gen Agent was smooth
✅ Jessica (PO): Daily demo kept stakeholders engaged
✅ Alex (AI Orch): Code quality from AI improved 8% vs. last week

Common theme: AI agents are getting better!

LEARNED:
💡 AI struggles with AWS IAM configurations - needs human expertise
💡 Image processing library (Sharp) has great AI-readable docs
💡 Daily demos > sprint reviews for stakeholder engagement
💡 Flaky tests cause major delays - need to prioritize fixing them

LACKED:
❌ Design spec wasn't detailed enough - AI had to guess UI layout
❌ Test environment DNS issues caused intermittent slowness
❌ Code review bottleneck - only Sarah available for 2 hours
❌ No visual regression testing capability

LONGED FOR:
🌟 Real-time test coverage visualization in IDE
🌟 AI agent with better architecture pattern understanding
🌟 Automated design mockup generation from requirements
🌟 Faster CI feedback (goal: <10 min)

Part 3: Action Commitments (5 min)

Priority 1: 🎯 Fix flaky test in image upload service
   Owner: Marcus
   Why: Caused 3 pipeline retries (45min delay)
   Done when: Test passes 10 consecutive CI runs
   Time: 1-2 hours

Priority 2: 🎯 Create architecture patterns guide for Code Gen Agent
   Owner: Sarah
   Why: Reduce AI guessing on design decisions
   Done when: AI follows patterns in next 3 features
   Time: 2 hours

Priority 3: 🎯 Add Jessica to code reviewer rotation
   Owner: Team (pair programming setup)
   Why: Eliminate review bottleneck
   Done when: Avg review time <30 min
   Time: 30 min setup

BACKLOG:
📋 Implement visual regression testing
📋 Investigate real-time coverage tools
📋 Explore AI design mockup tools
```

## Facilitator Tips

### For Flow Masters / Scrum Masters:

**Create Psychological Safety**:
✅ Emphasize "no blame" culture
✅ Focus on process, not people
✅ Celebrate failures as learning opportunities
✅ Encourage quiet voices to speak
✅ Thank people for honesty

**Keep Energy High**:
✅ Use timers to maintain pace
✅ Vary retrospective formats (avoid monotony)
✅ Celebrate wins enthusiastically
✅ End on positive note (actions = hope)

**Drive to Action**:
✅ Every retrospective must produce actions
✅ Actions must be specific and achievable
✅ Follow up on previous actions first
✅ Track completion rate
✅ Hold team accountable (gently)

**Leverage AI**:
✅ Let AI prepare data (saves time)
✅ Use AI insights to guide discussion
✅ Have AI suggest root causes
✅ Document in real-time with AI Scribe

## Red Flags in Retrospectives

🚩 Same issues every retrospective (not solving root cause)
🚩 No actions committed (talk without action)
🚩 Actions never completed (lack of follow-through)
🚩 Blame culture ("Why did X do that?")
🚩 Low participation (disengaged team)
🚩 Surface-level discussion (avoiding real issues)
🚩 Defensive reactions (not safe to share)
🚩 Running long (>30 min = losing focus)

**If you see red flags**:
1. Discuss the meta-issue (retrospective on retrospectives)
2. Change format to re-engage
3. Have 1-on-1 conversations to understand blockers
4. Consider bringing in external facilitator
5. Revisit team working agreements

---

## Special Retrospectives

### Weekly Deep Dive (Once per week, 60 min)

In addition to daily retrospectives, consider a weekly deep dive:

```

   - Quality trends

2. Deep discussion (30 min)
   - Pick one topic to go deep on
   - Root cause analysis
   - Multiple solutions brainstorming

3. Process improvements (15 min)
   - Methodology adjustments
   - Tool evaluations
   - Team capability building
```

### Monthly Team Health Check (90 min)

```
Agenda:
1. Team satisfaction survey results
2. Burnout check (workload, stress levels)
3. Skill development discussions
4. Career growth conversations
5. Team dynamics and collaboration
6. Celebration of monthly achievements
```
